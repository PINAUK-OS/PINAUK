# Required Libraries

Linking CryptoAPI functions requires the availability of Crypt32.lib. Programs using some of the functions may also require Advapi32.lib. You can get these files in the [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/). When using the VisualÂ C++ compiler, these files should be listed among the object/library modules.
