# Object State Constants

This topic describes the constant values used to describe the state of objects in an application UI. The state constants are defined in oleacc.h.

An object is associated with one or more of these state values at any time. The following object state constants are not used: STATE\_SYSTEM\_ALERT\_HIGH, STATE\_SYSTEM\_ALERT\_MEDIUM, STATE\_SYSTEM\_ALERT\_LOW, and STATE\_SYSTEM\_FLOATING.

Clients retrieve an object's state by calling [**IAccessible::get\_accState**](/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-get_accstate), which returns an integer that is a combination of the following bit flags. Clients call [**GetStateText**](/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-getstatetexta) with the state value to retrieve a localized string that describes the object's state.

When the state of an object changes, servers should call [**NotifyWinEvent**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-notifywinevent) with the [**EVENT\_OBJECT\_STATECHANGE**](event-constants.md) event constant. However, objects with the STATE\_SYSTEM\_INVISIBLE, STATE\_SYSTEM\_FOCUSED, and STATE\_SYSTEM\_ SELECTED object state constants have their own event constants. For these objects, do not use **EVENT\_OBJECT\_STATECHANGE**. Instead, use the individual event constant.

The following are object state constants:

| **STATE\_SYSTEM\_ALERT\_HIGH**<br>0x10000000               | (This object state constant is not supported.) <br/> Indicates important information to be immediately conveyed to the user. For example, when a battery reaches a critically low level, a level indicator generates a high-level alert. As a result, a blind access tool immediately announces this information to the user, and a screen magnification program scrolls the screen so that the battery indicator is in view. This state is also appropriate for any prompt or operation that must be completed before the user can continue.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **STATE\_SYSTEM\_ALERT\_MEDIUM**<br>0x8000000         | (This object state constant is not supported.)<br/> Indicates important information that is not conveyed immediately to the user. For example, when a battery is starting to reach a low level, a level indicator generates a medium-level alert. A blind access tool then generates a sound to let the user know that important information is available, without actually interrupting the user's work. The user could then query the alert information when convenient.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **STATE\_SYSTEM\_ALERT\_LOW**<br>0x4000000           | (This object state constant is not supported.)<br/> Indicates low-priority information that is not important to the user. This state is used, for example, when Word changes the appearance of the TipWizard button on its toolbar to indicate that it has a hint for the user.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **STATE\_SYSTEM\_ANIMATED**<br>0x4000                     | The object's appearance changes rapidly or constantly. Graphics that are animated occasionally are described as [**ROLE\_SYSTEM\_GRAPHIC**](object-roles.md) with the State property set to STATE\_SYSTEM\_ANIMATED. This state is used to indicate that the object's location is changing.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **STATE\_SYSTEM\_INVISIBLE**<br>0x8000                  | The object is programmatically hidden. For example, menu itmes are programmatically hidden until a user activates the menu. Because objects with this state are not available to users, client applications must not communicate information about the object to users. However, if client applications find an object with this state, they should check whether STATE\_SYSTEM\_OFFSCREEN is also set. If this second state is defined, clients can communicate the information about the object to users. For example, a list box can have both STATE\_SYSTEM\_INVISIBLE and STATE\_SYSTEM\_OFFSCREEN set. In this case, the client application can communicate all items in the list to users. <br/> If a client application is navigating through an [**IAccessible**](/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible) tree and encounters a parent object that is invisible, Microsoft Active Accessibility will not expose information about any possible children of the parent as long as the parent is invisible.<br/> |
