# Using the Microsoft Agent Character Editor

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

The Microsoft Agent Character Editor enables you to compile character animations for use with Microsoft Agent. You can define animations by importing Windows bitmap images, setting their duration, and optionally including branching, sound effects, and speaking overlays. For information about designing a character's animations, see [Designing Characters for Microsoft Agent](designing-characters-for-microsoft-agent.md).

With the Agent Character Editor you can define the character's name and description as well as output options, including text-to-speech (TTS), synthesized voice output, pop-up menu support, and the character's word balloon design.
