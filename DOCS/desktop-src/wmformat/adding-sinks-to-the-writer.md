# Adding Sinks to the Writer

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Writer sinks are separate objects from the writer and must be added to the writer to be used. If you are writing to a file, you can simply call [**IWMWriter::SetOutputFilename**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmwriter-setoutputfilename), which will set up the file sink automatically. Otherwise, to add a sink to the writer, call the [**IWMWriterAdvanced::AddSink**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmwriteradvanced-addsink) method. **AddSink** requires a pointer to the [**IWMWriterSink**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmwritersink) interface of the sink.

When you are finished using a sink, you should close it by calling the appropriate method, depending on the type of sink, and then remove it from the writer by calling [**IWMWriterAdvanced::RemoveSink**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmwriteradvanced-removesink).

The following example code shows how to create a writer file sink and add it to the writer. For more information about using this code, see [Using the Code Examples](using-the-code-examples.md).


```C++
HRESULT AddFileSink(IWMWriterFileSink** ppFileSink, IWMWriter* pWriter)
{
    HRESULT hr = S_OK;
    IWMWriterSink*     pSinkBase       = NULL;
    IWMWriterAdvanced* pWriterAdvanced = NULL;

    hr = CreateWriterFileSink(ppFileSink);
    GOTO_EXIT_IF_FAILED(hr);

    hr = *ppFileSink->QueryInterface(IID_IWMWriterSink, 
                                     (void**) &pSinkBase);
    GOTO_EXIT_IF_FAILED(hr);

    hr = pWriter->QueryInterface(IID_IWMWriterAdvanced,
                                 (void**) &pWriterAdvanced);
    GOTO_EXIT_IF_FAILED(hr);

    hr = pWriterAdvanced->AddSink(pSinkBase);
    GOTO_EXIT_IF_FAILED(hr);

Exit:
    SAFE_RELEASE(pSinkBase);
    SAFE_RELEASE(pWriterAdvanced);
    return hr;
}

```
