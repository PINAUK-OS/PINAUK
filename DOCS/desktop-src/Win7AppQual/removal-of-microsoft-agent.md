# Removal of Microsoft Agent

## Platform

**Clients** - Windows 7  
**Servers** - Windows Server 2008 R2  









## Feature Impact

 **Severity** - Medium  
**Frequency** - Low  


## Description

Microsoft has decided to discontinue development of Microsoft Agent technologies. Beginning with Windows 7, Microsoft Agent will not be included or supported in future versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. We encourage Microsoft Agent application developers and redistributors to evaluate their activities in light of this decision.

## Manifestation

-   Microsoft will not offer new licenses or renewals
-   Microsoft will not update the Microsoft Agent components, including:
    -   The "msagent.exe" runtime and libraries
    -   The characters Merlin, Genie, Peedy, and Robbo
    -   The Agent Character Editor
    -   All related Microsoft Agent software, tools, and documentation
-   Windows 7 and later versions will not support development of Microsoft Agent applications or characters
