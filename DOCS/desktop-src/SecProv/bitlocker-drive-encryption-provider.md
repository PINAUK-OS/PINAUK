# BitLocker Drive Encryption Provider

The WMI provider interface is for managing and configuring BitLocker Drive Encryption (BDE) on currently supported versions of [Windows Server](/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info) and [Windows client](/windows/release-health/supported-versions-windows-client). It is intended to be read by those writing scripts, user interface elements, or other administrative tools for BDE as well as people who want to understand more about BDE functionality.
