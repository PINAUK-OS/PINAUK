# Creating a Private Sensor Pool

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For secure biometric sensors, only enrollments in the Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) authorized enrollment database will be able to authorize key release. This means that existing third-party secure biometric enrollment applications will not be able to enroll or perform Windows Biometric (WinBio) calls.Â 

> [!NOTE]
> The WinBio API surface is not supported for Windows Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS) fingerprint sensors.

A private sensor pool is a collection of biometric units reserved for exclusive use by a client application. Private pools support proprietary authentication methods and enable a client application to access a biometric unit by using vendor-specified control commands.

The topics in this section contain code examples that explain how to create a private sensor pool.
