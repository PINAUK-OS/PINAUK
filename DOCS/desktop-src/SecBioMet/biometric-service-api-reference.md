# Windows Biometric Framework API Reference

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For secure biometric sensors, only enrollments in the Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) authorized enrollment database will be able to authorize key release. This means that existing third-party secure biometric enrollment applications will not be able to enroll or perform Windows Biometric (WinBio) calls.Â 

> [!NOTE]
> The WinBio API surface is not supported for Windows Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS) fingerprint sensors.
